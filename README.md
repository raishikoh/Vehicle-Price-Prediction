# **Driving the Future of Vehicle Pricing: A Machine Learning Approach**

By: Ali Sehpar Shikoh 

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the "Driving the Future of Vehicle Pricing: A Machine Learning Approach" project. In this project, our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a vehicle based on various factors such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. The automobile industry is one of the largest and most competitive industries in the world, with millions of vehicles being sold each year. The price of a vehicle can have a significant impact on a consumer's purchasing decision, and it is crucial for both buyers and sellers to have an understanding of the market value of a vehicle. Through the use of machine learning algorithms and data analysis, we aim to provide a reliable and robust model that can assist in determining the fair market value of a vehicle. Join us on this exciting journey as we delve into the world of vehicle price prediction.

## **The Data**
This data was obtained using web scraping techniques on [cargurus.com](https://www.cargurus.com/). This data is for academic, research and individual experimentation only and is not intended for commercial purposes. This dataset contains 3 million new and used vehicle listings in the United States. The data set can be downloaded on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset?select=used_cars_data.csv). The data dictionary can be downloaded/reviewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/177p54r5GarfVBSzNn3jFTkHS1N-yXNwx/view?usp=share_link)

## **Summary**

This is a Vehicle Price Prediction Project that aims to address a critical business problem in the automotive industry: determining the fair market value of a vehicle accurately. The price of a vehicle is a key factor in a consumer's purchasing decision, and having an accurate understanding of a vehicle's market value is crucial for both buyers and sellers. However, determining the fair market value of a vehicle can be a complex and challenging task as it depends on several factors such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location. Therefore, there is a growing need for a reliable and objective tool that can assist in determining the market value of a vehicle.

To achieve this goal, advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques were utilized to predict the price of a vehicle based on relevant factors. The dataset used for this project was obtained by web scraping techniques on cargurus.com and contained three million new and used vehicle listings in the United States.

Data cleaning is an essential step in the vehicle price prediction project as it helps to prepare the data for analysis and modeling. Missing values, duplicate values, outliers, categorical variables, feature scaling, and feature engineering were handled during the data cleaning process.

Exploratory data analysis was then performed to gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify trends, patterns, outliers, and anomalies that could impact the accuracy of the predictions, and formulate hypotheses about the relationships between the variables. This information was used to refine the data cleaning steps and feature engineering and select the appropriate modeling techniques.

The modeling process aimed to build a predictive model for the target variable based on the features collected in the dataset. Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree, and random forest, were trained and evaluated. After careful evaluation, the random forest model was selected as the best model for this project, with an R-squared value of 0.96 and a mean absolute error of 0.67.

The results of this project can be used by car dealerships or consumers to make informed decisions about vehicle prices. However, it is important to note that the model's accuracy is only as good as the data it was trained on and limitations may arise when applied to new, unseen data. Further work could be done to gather additional data and improve the model's robustness.

In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of data exploration, feature engineering, and model selection in building a successful machine learning model. The power of machine learning in predicting real-world problems is demonstrated, and the results can be used to address the critical business problem of determining the fair market value of a vehicle.
